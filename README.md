# fiducia-brain

The **control plane** for [fiducia.cloud](https://fiducia.cloud) — a small,
highly-available cluster that runs *inside* the larger deployment and runs the
cluster itself. The control logic is **implemented**: time-based failure
detection (Healthy→Suspect→Dead), the placement math ([`src/plan.rs`](src/plan.rs):
keep healthy replicas, drop dead/draining ones, fill to RF on the least-loaded
node in a fresh failure domain), leadership affinity/failover, and the
reconciliation loop + HTTP API are all live and unit-tested. What remains is
replicating the brain's *own* state (membership + placement) in its **own Raft
group** so the control plane itself survives losing a brain node (the HA note
at the bottom).

## What the brain does

The data plane ([`fiducia-node`](https://github.com/fiducia-cloud/fiducia-node.rs))
stores and replicates coordination state in sharded Raft groups. It deliberately
does **not** decide *which* nodes host *which* shards — that is the brain's job:

- **Membership & failure detection** — every node heartbeats to the brain;
  silent nodes go Healthy → Suspect → Dead.
- **Shard placement** — owns the authoritative shard → (replicas, preferred
  leader) map that data-plane nodes fetch and reconcile toward.
- **Node-failure handling** — when a node is declared Dead, its shard replicas
  are re-placed onto healthy nodes to restore the replication factor.
- **Scale up / down** — drives the cluster toward a desired `ScalePlan`
  (target node count × replication factor): bleeds shards onto new nodes,
  drains and removes nodes on scale-down.
- **Rebalancing** — keeps replica counts and leadership spread evenly so no
  node becomes a write hotspot.

This mirrors the "placement driver" pattern: TiKV's **PD** and CockroachDB's
control plane do the same thing for their range/region maps.

## Sharding & scaling strategy

**Two layers, kept separate** (this is the whole trick):

```text
  key ──hash(key) % shard_count──▶ shard      stable · stateless · no lookup
  shard ──placement map──────────▶ nodes      elastic · central · changes on scale
```

- **`shard_count` is fixed at cluster creation** ([`config.rs`](src/config.rs)) and
  generously sized (e.g. 256/1024). It defines `key → shard`, so **no key ever
  moves when you add/remove nodes**. Every component computes `key → shard`
  locally (same `fnv1a`); only `shard → nodes` needs the central map.
- **Node count is elastic.** Scaling rewrites only the `shard → nodes` placement.

**Central configuration** = the brain's replicated state: the immutable
`ClusterConfig` + the mutable `shard → {replicas, preferred_leader}` placement
map ([`placement.rs`](src/placement.rs)). Meant to live in the brain's own Raft
group so it is consistent and survives a brain-node loss.

**Membership change is one replica at a time** (every scaling phase uses this):
`add learner` (non-voting, catches up via snapshot + log) → `promote` to voter →
optional `transfer leadership` → `remove` old replica. Never add a far-behind
voter; never drop below quorum; throttle concurrent moves.

The reconciler ([`scheduler.rs`](src/scheduler.rs)) runs four phases each tick:

| Phase | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **re-replicate** | node Dead / shard below RF | add replica on least-loaded healthy node (highest priority) |
| **scale up** | healthy nodes < target | bleed replicas/leadership onto new nodes until balanced |
| **scale down** | healthy nodes > target | drain lightest nodes, evacuate replicas, release (floor = RF) |
| **balance leadership** | lopsided leader counts | transfer leadership toward `shard_count / nodes` per node |

Balance objectives: RF replicas/shard · spread across failure domains · even
replicas per node · even **leaders** per node (the real write hotspot).
